- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Amber and I'm looking to break into tech!
- ðŸ“« I'd love to connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/amber-lowman-062407189/


- ðŸŒ± I'd say I'm pretty deep into the tech world now. I've really developed my skillset, being 100% self taught has allowed me to really explore the areas I'm interested in. I've got most of what I know displayed on here, with lots of projects coming up.

- I mean it when I say I have found my passion in tech, specifically Machine Learning and Data Science. I am so excited to find a role I can commit to and grow in.

- My skills: HTML | CSS | Flexbox | Bootstrap | JavaScript (JS) | ES6 / ECMAScript | React | SQL | Visual Studio Code (VSCode) | API | Node.js | VMWare | GitHub | GitHub Hosting | Microsoft Active Directory (AD) | Python | Miniconda | Conda | Jupyter | Jypter notebook | Anaconda | MiniConda | Conda | Pandas | Matplotlib | NumPy | SciKit-Learn / Sklearn | Seaborn |TensorFlow | PyTorch | DMLCXGBoost | CatBoost | AI | Machine Learning | Data Science
