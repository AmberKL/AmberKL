- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Amber and I HAVE broken into tech! Wow, what a thing to write.
- I'm a SQL Developer - who would've thought I'd follow into my dads steps. I work for a great company, and I'm actually teaching myself .NET too. The opportunities to learn really are endless.
- I'm hoping to continue some cool personal projects, so I'm looking forward to getting back into that... Maybe make some applications with my new found skills.
- I'm happy to say I still feel like I've found my passion in tech. It's fascinating, and I'm still hugely into Machine Learning and Data Science.
